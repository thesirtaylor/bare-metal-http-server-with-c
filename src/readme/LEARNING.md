## üîç Learning Path

### For Beginners

1. Start the server and visit `http://localhost:8080/`
2. Read `/info` to understand networking basics
3. Read `/how-it-works` to understand the request/response cycle
4. Look at `src/server.c` to see socket code
5. Look at `src/routes.c` to see routing

### For Intermediate

1. Study `src/http_handler.c` to understand HTTP parsing
2. Look at `src/api.c` to see JSON API implementation
3. Read about multi-threading in `MULTIPLE_CLIENTS.md`
4. Try modifying handlers to add new endpoints
5. Experiment with the JSON builder

### For Advanced

1. Study `src/api_client.c` to see HTTP client implementation
2. Implement your own JSON parser
3. Add support for HTTP/2
4. Implement WebSockets
5. Add TLS/SSL support
6. Implement connection pooling
